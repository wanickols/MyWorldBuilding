## To Download
This is an ue4 4.27 project. It is a very large file, but does not use lfs for any files. 

## Purpose
This is a personal project for fun and learning. My goal is to learn about the unreal engine and see what I can do! By applying what I learn in classes, reading articles, and watching helpful videos, I hope to make some awesome landscapes and effects. 

## Benefits
So far, I have learned so much about unreal in general. In particular, the landscaping tools, geometry tools, a general understanding of lighting in unreal, and more. While I understand how much more I have to learn with each moment, I am enjoying every minute of it! ü•≥
After the basics of landscaping, I went on to decorating my land with foliage. I began with the foliage tool, and learned the power of it, but later I came to prefer procedural foliage as it did the work for me and saved memory. My lighting skills have gotten somewhat better and I have been putting emphasis on making the world feel alive, natural, and seemless. 

## Status
This project is a personal project and not school or work, so I will update it when I am able to. Hopefully, this will be fairly regularly!
