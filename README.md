## To Download
This project will require using git Large File Storage (lfs) to download and is an ue4 4.27 project. 

## Purpose
This is a personal project for fun and learning. My goal is to learn about the unreal engine and see what I can do! By applying what I learn in classes, reading articles, and watching helpful videos, I hope to make some awesome landscapes and effects. 

## Benefits
So far, I have learned so much about unreal in general. In particular, the landscaping tools, geometry tools, a general understanding of lighting in unreal, and more. While I understand how much more I have to learn with each moment, I am enjoying every minute of it! ü•≥

## Status
This project is a personal project and not school or work, so I will update it when I can. I hope to be able to work on it fairly regularly.
